What kind of value does the function getFirstVowel return?

An optional string.

Of the three ways that you unwrapped the value of firstVowel, which do you feel was most appropriate for this situation, and why?

The only one I did, because that is the only one I was able to complete in the given time.

This exercise assumes that you do, in fact, have a vowel (of the English language) in your name. What, if anything, would you need to change about the code if your name was "Bj√∏rk" or "Ghrftnx"?

I would need to create an else situation for nil, and print a message telling the user that there are no vowels in their name.
